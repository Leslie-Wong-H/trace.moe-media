### Media server for serving video preview for [trace.moe](https://github.com/soruly/trace.moe)

Currently used by Telegram Bot [@whatanimebot](http://t.me/whatanimebot)

A "video scene cutter" which naturally detect timestamp boundaries of a scene, and then trim a scene out without leaking / exposing other frames that belongs to other scenes.

This is used to prevent abuse of using earlier/later parts of a preview as another search image to recursively reveal extra duration of the original video, protecting the original content.
